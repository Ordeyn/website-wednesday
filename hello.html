        <p>Before she picks me up, I sit in a plastic chair on the porch and stare at the oval moon. 
            I look at it so long that when I blink, I can see it’s chalky print on my retina. 
            I spend some time reminding myself that the moon is a three-dimensional sphere, not just a picture in the sky, 
            and I try to hold its oblong shape in my mind like it’s water in my palms.
        </p>
        <p>I see her car lights on the trees as she pulls into the driveway, 
            and I get up to meet her. On the way to her friend’s apartment, 
            speeding down the backroads to upbeat pop music, we take turns catching up on the other’s activities. 
            She likes her job; I like mine. A brief spell spent on high school and boys. 
            Now, we’re going to have a good time that we wouldn’t have considered just a few months ago.
        </p>
        <p>Her friend drives us to the first bar where we take turns turning bills into quarters to play three-way pool. 
            For the first game, we are essentially the only ones there. 
            By the third game, more people are emerging from their cacophony of day jobs and classes into the equally chaotic weekend nightlife. 
            After game three, we decide to move on and tell the guy at the table next to us that, no, we don’t want to play doubles with him.</p>
