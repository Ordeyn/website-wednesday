            My name is Caroline. I wanted a project to do that would be fun and
            allow me to hone in my computer programming skills in both front-end web development
            and back-end things like a small database. This project is all about trying to take
            all the things I've learned over the past few years and execute them in one, fairly
            reasonable project. I'm going to graduate school this fall to earn a degree in
            Library Science, and more specifically one that focuses on Data Science&mdash;where
            a programming mindeset is essential. Not only is the project meant to be something just
            for fun, but it also serves a purpose, like play. Thanks for reading! Enjoy! BOOBS!
